Features

    Data Collection: The repository provides examples of how to collect historical financial data for a set of assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs) from reliable sources such as Yahoo Finance or Quandl.

    Data Preprocessing: Demonstrates data preprocessing techniques to clean the raw financial data and align it appropriately for efficient analysis.

    Efficient Frontier: Implements the Modern Portfolio Theory using the Efficient Frontier technique to find the optimal asset allocation that maximizes returns for a given level of risk.

    PCA: Shows how to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the asset returns, leading to better diversification and risk management.

    K-Means Clustering: Utilizes K-Means clustering to group assets with similar risk and return characteristics, enabling the creation of well-diversified clusters in the portfolio.

    Portfolio Optimization: Combines the concepts of Efficient Frontier, PCA, and K-Means to create a robust portfolio optimization model that aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

    Visualization: Provides visualizations of the Efficient Frontier, PCA components, and K-Means clusters to aid in understanding the portfolio construction process.

Usage

    Collect historical financial data for the assets of interest.

    Preprocess the data and align it for analysis.

    Run the Efficient Frontier code to optimize the portfolio:

bash

python efficient_frontier.py

    Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of asset returns:

bash

python pca_analysis.py

    Utilize K-Means clustering to group assets into clusters:

bash

python k_means_clustering.py

    Combine Efficient Frontier, PCA, and K-Means for comprehensive portfolio optimization.

Data

The financial data used for the examples can be found in the data/ directory. It contains historical prices or returns for various assets.
Efficient Frontier

The efficient_frontier.py script contains the implementation of the Modern Portfolio Theory using the Efficient Frontier. It computes the optimal asset allocation to maximize returns given different levels of risk.
PCA

The pca_analysis.py script demonstrates how to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of asset returns and achieve better diversification in the portfolio.
K-Means Clustering

The k_means_clustering.py script shows how to use K-Means clustering to group assets based on their risk and return characteristics, assisting in portfolio diversification.
